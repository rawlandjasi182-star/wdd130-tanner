            <h3>Where to Find Parts</h3>
            <p>The Mustang community has established numerous reliable suppliers over the decades.

                <h3>Budget-Friendly Tips</h3>
                <p>Start with mechanical components to get your Mustang running reliably. Cosmetic parts can be added gradually as your budget allows. Join Mustang forums and clubs to learn about group buys and discounts. Consider purchasing complete kits rather than individual pieces - they often provide better value. Don't overlook salvage yards, which can be goldmines for original parts at fraction of reproduction costs.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Quality vs. Price</h3>
            <p>While affordable parts are available, it's important to balance cost with quality. For critical components like brakes, steering, and suspension, invest in reputable brands. For less critical items like interior trim or cosmetic pieces, budget-friendly options often provide excellent results. Research suppliers and read reviews from other Mustang enthusiasts to ensure you're getting good value.</p>
