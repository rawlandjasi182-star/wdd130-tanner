            <h2>Affordable parts for 1968-69 Mustangs</h2>
            
            <p>Most of the time, car parts are expensive. But not here. The average cost to restore a 1968-1969 mustang is $20,000, compared to other cars that can cost upwards of $50,000. </p>

                <h3>Simple Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Cars are normally very complicated machines. Not the 1968-69 mustangs. They are so simple to work on that you can do almost anything with a 10 minute Youtube video.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>An excellent choice you won't regret</h3>

                    <h3>Affordable Parts</h3>
                    <p>Unlike many classic cars, parts for 1968-69 Mustangs are widely available and reasonably priced. The high production numbers and continued popularity ensure a steady supply of both original and reproduction parts.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Simple Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>Before the age of complex electronics, these Mustangs featured straightforward mechanical systems that are easy to understand, diagnose, and repair - even for beginners.</p>

                    <h3>Timeless Design</h3>
                    <p>The classic mustangs are just as good looking today as they were 60 years ago. The square body, the round headlights, the wood highlights on the interior all come together to give these beauty’s a design that has lived for ages and will continue living for generations to come.
Amazing sound text: Let’s be honest. Everyone loves the sound of the classic V8 that these monsters come with. The roar of the exhaust as you accelerate will turn heads and leave people thinking “that’s a good looking car.” If you really want to make people stop and stare, you can upgrade the exhaust and take off the muffler and let the raw power of that V8 be heard with every turn of the crankshaft.</p>
